                    <p>
                        {% blocktranslate %}I still remember walking into a robotics expo as a child and being completely blown away. The
                        blinking LEDs, the moving joints... The feeling that I was witnessing the <strong>future</strong>...
                        That moment stuck with me. Ever since, I’ve been hooked on sci-fi, cyberpunk, and everything
                        that feels like it belongs in a tomorrow that’s already here.{% endblocktranslate %}
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        {% blocktranslate %}Before I even finished high school, I was already building rudimentary programs, full of bugs and
                        excitement. I remember thinking, <em>“I could do this for the rest of my life.”</em> So I did.{% endblocktranslate %}

                    <p>
                        {% blocktranslate %}I build complex backend systems. It’s where I feel most at home; architecting infrastructure,
                        optimizing processes, and spinning up APIs and services that hum with efficiency. I’ve spent
                        over a decade crafting digital platforms for everything from social good to business
                        logistics.{% endblocktranslate %}

                    <p>
                        {% blocktranslate %}My main stack today centers around <strong>Python</strong> (which I love for its clarity and
                        flexibility), and I deploy most of my solutions on <strong>AWS</strong>, where spinning up EC2
                        instances and wiring up scalable architecture feels like second nature.{% endblocktranslate %}
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        {% blocktranslate %}Over the years, I’ve also become really fast, and really good, at shipping web applications and
                        APIs from scratch. Startup life taught me that adaptability is a skill, and learning new tech is
                        just part of the fun.{% endblocktranslate %}

                    <p>
                        {% blocktranslate %}Problem-solving has always been my engine. But more recently, it’s become about more than just
                        logic, it’s about <strong>impact</strong>. I’ve worked with organizations like the <strong>World
                            Bank Group</strong> on digital tools that help communities in Africa connect with
                        governments, track climate vulnerabilities, and promote peace. In Venezuela, I’ve supported
                        social research by building data collection apps used in the field.{% endblocktranslate %}
